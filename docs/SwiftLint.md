# SwiftLint

This file describes how to set up and integrate SwiftLint into our project.

## How to set up the environment

1. [Install SwiftLint via Homebrew](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#using-homebrew).
2. [Integrate SwiftLint into an Xcode scheme](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#xcode). Just add a new ["Run Script Phase"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632301/where-is-the-run-script-and-build-phase-in-xcode).


## How to configure SwiftLint

We are currently using the default set of [rules](https://realm.github.io/SwiftLint/rule-directory.html) of SwiftLint.

You can [configure SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#configuration) by modifying the [.swiftlint.yml](../.swiftlint.yml) file. All changes must be agreed with the team.
