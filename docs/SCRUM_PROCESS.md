#### Scrum Artifacts

See [Agile board](https://github.com/dersim-davaod/CocoaHeads-iOS-School-Twitter-project/projects/1) to find more information about Scrum Artifacts.

Agile board consists of several columns that describe every step of the process:

 - Backlog - an ordered list of known product requirements.
 - Sprint Backlog - a set of Backlog issues that are taken in Sprint.
 - In Progress - issues are currently being worked on.
 - PR - issues which has active PRs and PRs cards.
 - Done - issues have been completed.

When a developer drags an issue on the Agile board, the issue changes its status.
 1. When a developer assignees issue he dragging it into the **In Progress** column, it means he starts to work on it. 
 1. After the work is done he opens a new PR and requests review from collaborators, at the same time the issue should be dragged into the **PR** column. Automatically PRs card adds into the **PR** column. 
 1. If all reviewers approve the task and it is merged, the issue must be dragged into the **Done** column.
 1. If someone doesn't approve the task, the issue must be dragged into the **In Progress** column. 

#### The Sprint

We work with sprints as described in [Scrum Guide](#scrum) with some specific details:

 - our sprints last one week.
 - each sprint starts on Monday and ends on Friday.
 - if the beginning or end of the Sprint is public holiday, the team should agree on the updated date during the sprint planning.

#### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. We have our Daily Scrum each workday, but if someone wants to work on weekends he should leave his status in the document asynchronously.

See [The daily status](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1swL2wWhy6hZb2XJzyvXoQbx3UiBeuGJYmSXoTl4N0NA/edit#gid=0) document to find the details on daily scrum statuses of our Development Team.

#### Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint. This is at most a one-hour meeting for one-week Sprints.

#### Sprint Retrospective

After the Sprint Review our Scrum Team have the Sprint Retrospective. This is at most a one-hour meeting for one-week Sprints. On the Sprint Retrospective meeting we discuss the questions in the same way as described in the [Scrum Guide](#scrum).

See [Notes about retrospective](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-9C6O2Z3nYUSz6iaBnfQODPEN3vocRj19LgzYjfdxg/edit#gid=0) for more details on past retrospectives.

#### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of two hours for a one-week Sprint.
 * During the Sprint Planning our team make Estimation of the tasks.
   - You should write Estimation in the issue. More details about the issues you can find in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#issues)
   - Estimation defines in hours.
   - We are using a three-points technique for exposure of Estimation. More information about the three-points technique you can find here: [Three-point estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_estimation). 
   - Do not forget to add extra time (reading documentation, etc.) if necessary when estimating tasks.
 * Also, each member of the team must notify about the number of hours that he can spend on the project daily during the Sprint.
 * During the Sprint Planning we calculate our Capacity and then we define amount of tasks that we can take in the Sprint. 
 * Also during Sprint Planning we make Acceptance Criteria.
   - Don't assign an issue if the issue doesn't have Acceptance Criteria.
   - If you don't understand Acceptance Criteria, don't be afraid to clarify it.

See [Sprint notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxbVa85ZyZQN0tlnibdIgxR1PC301dWRXumpPnWi33w/edit) document to find the Sprint Goal, Capacity and Sprint Notes for the current and past sprints.
