This code of conduct applies to the BulbaTalks project’s team.  You can find a list of team members in the file [README.md](../README.md#authors). In addition, violations of this code outside that project may affect a person’s ability to participate within them.

## Code of Conduct Committee

The BulbaTalks project team has committees to handle cases of violation of the interaction rules described below. The current committees are:

-  Dersim Davaod  (Telegram: @dersimdavaod)

-  Tatsiana Khizhniak (Telegram: @tanyakhiz)

-  Dzmitry Krukov (Telegram: @silvaby)

## Code of Conduct

-  **Be friendly and patient.**

-  **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the BulbaTalks community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the BulbaTalks community.

-  **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. 

-  **Avoid discriminatory jokes and behavior.** Do not insult or put down other participants. 

-  **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and BulbaTalks project’s team is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Reporting Guide

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you inform us of this using the Telegram account of any member of the Code of Conduct Committee.

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**In your report please include all information about an incident:**

-  Names of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.

-  When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.

-  Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive) please include a link.

-  Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.

-  If you believe this incident is ongoing.

-  Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?

We promise to answer your report within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will meet to review the incident as soon as possible and determine what happened and who was right.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

-  Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).

-  A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.

-  A public reprimand.

-  A request for a public or private apology.

-  10 whips at the closest sprint’s retrospective.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.
